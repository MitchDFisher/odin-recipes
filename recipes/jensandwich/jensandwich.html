    <h1>The Jen Sandwich</h1>
    <div id="picture1"><img src="images/jensandwich.jpg" /></div>
    <h3 id="bread">Thanking my Mum Again</h3>
    <p id="bacon">
      This Sandwich comes from my late teens/early 20's. I was at Drama 5 days a
      week, working or at the gym straight after and I was getting home around
      23:00 everynight. Too late to cook a nice decent meal, too fussy to put
      crap like pot noddles into my body. My mum knew the answer and would often
      makes this bad boy just as I would arrive home. It became a favourite in
      the household. When friends came over, they would inquire to see if said
      sandwich was on the menu/availale for the night. Thanks Mum.
